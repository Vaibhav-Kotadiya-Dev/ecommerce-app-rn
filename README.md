# Build an E-Commerce App with React Native
### Mobile App

You'll need the [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) installed in order to run this app.

- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Instal iOS native depencies: `npx pod-install`
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and add the necessary values.
  - **Note:** If you're running the app on a physical device or Android emulator you'll need to use your machine's IP address in place of `localhost` for the `API_URL` in your environment file.
- Run on iOS: `yarn ios`
- Run on Android: `yarn android`
